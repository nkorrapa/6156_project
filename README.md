# Soarroute Flight Delay Predictions
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://soarroute-flightdelay-predictions.streamlit.app/)

An Interactive Streamlit App Dashboard to analyze and predict the expected Flight Delays based on weather, airlines and flight origin-destination [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) module to improve the travel experience. These models help stakeholders make data-driven decisions, like optimizing schedules or managing airport resources.

Data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (bts.gov) collected during 01 June 2024 to 30 June 2024, were analyzed to assess Flight Delay Predictions


## Results:
* Decision Tree and KNN models built, trained to predict flight delays
* Neural Network to predict the Flight delay

## Authors
Sammie Srabani, Neha Korrapati, Leela Josna Kona, Devangi Samal

## Objectives
* Identify potential delay flights

* Building a strategies to predict most common reason for delay 

## Dataset and model
* Bureau of Transportation Statistics (bts.gov)

## Libraries Used
* [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io)
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/): (`streamlit.plotly_chart`)
* Keras and TensorFlow
